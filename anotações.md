propriedades dos tipos classicos:
- We can ignore duplicate classical annotations: !!τ ≡ !τ
- Classical commutes with tuples: !(τ × τ) ≡ !τ × !τ (analogously for n-tuples with n>2). As a consequence, we also have !(τ × τ) ≡ !(τ × !τ) ≡ !(!τ × τ) ≡ !(!τ × !τ)
- Classical commutes with arrays: !τ[] ≡ (!τ)[] ≡ !(τ[])
- Classical commutes with fixed-length arrays: !τ^n ≡ (!τ)^n ≡ !(τ^n)
- Classical values can be re-interpreted as quantum values: !τ <: τ
